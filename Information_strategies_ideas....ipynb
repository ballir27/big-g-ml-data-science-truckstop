    "# Big G Express: Predicting Derates\n",
    "In this project, you will be working with fault code data and vehicle onboard diagnostic data to try and predict an upcoming full derate. These are indicated by an SPN 5246. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with a two files containing the data you will use to make these predictions (J1939Faults.csv and VehicleDiagnosticOnboardData.csv) as well as two files describing some of the contents (DataInfo.docx and Service Fault Codes_1_0_0_167.xlsx) \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in its raw form the data does not have \"labels\", so you must define what labels you are going to use and create those labels in your dataset. Also, you will likely need to perform some significant feature engineering in order to build an accurate predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are service locations at (36.0666667, -86.4347222), (35.5883333, -86.4438888), and (36.1950, -83.174722), so you should remove any records in the vicinity of these locations, as fault codes may be tripped when working on the vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating the performance of your model, assume that the cost associated with a missed full derate is approximately $4000.00$ in towing and repairs, and the cost of a false positive prediction is about $500 due to having the truck off the road and serviced unnecessarily."

    "##### Why Derate?\n",
    "A derate is designed to protect you from causing engine or DPF damage. A derate can be caused by various sensors or systems. However, when it's a specific 5 MPH derate then you can be certain that the problem is related to the emissions, aka the aftertreatment system.\n",

    "  *  Pull out EquipmentID, RecordID, timestamp on every fault code that has a derate.\n",
    "  *  Then look at all fault codes that are timestamped between 2 and 24 hours before, pulling ID data from there.\n",
    "  *      (You might have to create your own unique index?)\n",
    "  *  Then, run through diagnostics, pulling all data with correct RecordID\n",
    "  *  Possible interesting columns:\n",
    "  *      Number of records\n",
    "  *      Number of faults\n",
